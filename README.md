A schema-first framework to **track, version, and store the full lineage of data transformations** ‚Äî from raw ingestion to final model output ‚Äî using Walacor as a backend snapshot store.

---

## ‚ú® Why this exists
- **Reproducibility** ‚Äì Every transformation, parameter, and artifact is captured in a graph you can replay.
- **Auditability** ‚Äì Snapshots are immutable, version-controlled, and timestamped.
- **Collaboration** ‚Äì Team members see the same lineage and can compare or branch workflows.
- **Extensibility** ‚Äì Strict JSON-schemas keep today‚Äôs pipelines clean while allowing tomorrow‚Äôs to evolve safely.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Core Concepts

| Concept | Stored as | Purpose |
| ------- | --------- | ------- |
| **Transform Node** | `transform_node` | One operation (e.g., ‚Äúfit model‚Äù, ‚Äúclean text‚Äù). |
| **Transform Edge** | `transform_edge` | Dependency between two nodes. |
| **Project Metadata** | `project_metadata` | Run-level info (owner, description, timestamps). |

> **Immutable Snapshots**
> Once a DAG is written to Walacor, it cannot mutate‚Äîonly a *new* snapshot (with a higher SV or run ID) can supersede it.

---


## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Install the SDKs

```bash
pip install walatrack
````

> Make sure you're using Python 3.10+ and have internet access to reach the Walacor API.

### 2. Initialize the Tracking Components

To begin capturing your data lineage:

* **Start the Tracker** ‚Äì This manages the session and records operations.
* **Attach an Adapter** ‚Äì For example, use `PandasAdapter` to automatically track DataFrame transformations.
* **Add Writers** ‚Äì Choose where to send the output:

  * Console output for quick inspection
  * WalacorWriter to persist snapshots to the Walacor backend

Once set up, your transformation history will be automatically recorded and can be exported or persisted.

---


## üß™ Example Use Cases

* Track changes in a machine learning pipeline
* Visualize column-level transformations in pandas
* Record versions of a dataset as it‚Äôs cleaned and merged
* Keep an auditable log of automated workflows

---

Here‚Äôs the updated `README.md` with a concise, illustrative example that highlights how easy it is to use `walatrack`. This is placed right after the **Getting Started** section and demonstrates a realistic tracking flow with minimal code:

---

## üß™ Minimal Example

Here's how simple it is to start tracking transformations:

```python
import pandas as pd
from walatrack import Tracker, PandasAdapter
from walatrack.writers import ConsoleWriter
from walatrack.writers.walacor import WalacorWriter

# 1. Start the tracker and adapter
tracker = Tracker().start()
adapter = PandasAdapter().start(tracker)

# 2. Define writers (console, or send to Walacor backend)
console_writer = ConsoleWriter()
walacor_writer = WalacorWriter(
    base_url="http://your-walacor-url/api",
    username="your-username",
    password="your-password",
    project_name="MyProject",
    description="Optiona Description"
)

# 3. Apply transformations as usual
df = pd.DataFrame({"id": [1, 2], "value": [100, 200]})
df2 = df.assign(new_val=df.value * 2)
df3 = df2.rename(columns={"value": "v"})

# 4. Stop and export the lineage
tracker.stop()

````

> üí° The `PandasAdapter` automatically tracks operations like `.assign()`, `.rename()`, `.merge()`, etc., so you can work with pandas as usual ‚Äî but with versioned lineage behind the scenes.

This snippet:
- Is short enough to understand at a glance
- Avoids hardcoded credentials or IPs
- Clearly reflects your existing setup
- Shows the power and simplicity of the library

### Parameter rules at a glance

| Filter combo                   | What you get                              |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `project_name` **only**        | all nodes / all edges in the project      |
| `project_name + pipeline_name` | all runs & nodes for that pipeline        |
| `project_name + run_uid`       | nodes/edges of one specific run           |
| `user_tag`                     | optional extra filter on any of the above |

### Example usage

```python
# 1Ô∏è‚É£ list all runs of ‚Äútrain_model‚Äù in ‚ÄúML_Proj‚Äù
runs = wal_writer.get_runs("ML_Proj", pipeline_name="train_model")
first_run = runs[0]["UID"]

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ pull the DAG for that first run
dag = wal_writer.get_dag("ML_Proj", run_uid=first_run)

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ quick print
for n in dag["nodes"]:
    print(n["operation"], n["shape"])
```

> These helpers leverage the official **[Walacor Python SDK](https://github.com/walacor/python-sdk)**, so every call hits Walacor‚Äôs fast *summary* view and transparently re-uses the writer‚Äôs authenticated session‚Äîno extra login or handshake required.
